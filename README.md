Welcome to my Agile Final Project! This repository contains the backend development for an e-commerce product catalog, created as part of my learning journey on Coursera's Agile and Scrum course.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a backend system to manage an e-commerce product catalog with essential features including:

- **User Engagement**: Like and dislike products.
- **Advanced Search**: Query and filter products based on various criteria.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy the application in the cloud.
- **Automated Deployments**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.

2. **Sprint Planning**: Planned tasks for a 2-week sprint.
3. **Development**: Implemented features using Agile best practices.
4. **Review & QA**: Conducted thorough testing and quality assurance.
