# Agile Planning Final Project: Kanban Board

## Project Overview

This project is my final assignment for the Agile Planning course. I created a Kanban board to conveniently track the progress of user stories.

## Kanban Board Workflow

1. **Creating the Board**:
    - The Kanban board is divided into several columns representing different stages of the workflow.
    - Columns used:
      - **New Issues**: Newly created tasks that haven't started yet.
      - **Icebox**: Tasks ready to be picked up.
      - **Product Backlog**: Actively worked on tasks.
      - **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks planned for the current sprint.
      - **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
      - **Review/QA**: Tasks under review.
      - **Done**: Completed tasks.

2. **Adding Tasks**:
    - Each task is added to the **New Issues** column.
    - Tasks can be moved to the **Icebox** for preparation.

3. **Working on Tasks**:
    - When a task is ready to be worked on, it is moved to the **Product Backlog**.
    - Tasks planned for the current sprint are moved to the **Sprint Backlog**.
    - During work, tasks are moved to **In Progress**.

4. **Review and Completion**:
    - Completed tasks are moved to **Review/QA** for quality checks.
    - After successful review, tasks are moved to **Done**.

## How to Use

To work with the Kanban board:

1. **Create a New Task**: Add a new task to the **New Issues** column.
2. **Prepare for Work**: Move the task to the **Icebox** for preparation.
3. **Active Work**: Move the task to the **Product Backlog** when ready to start.
4. **Plan Sprint**: Move tasks to the **Sprint Backlog** for the current sprint.
5. **In Progress**: Move tasks to **In Progress** while working on them.
6. **Quality Review**: Move completed tasks to **Review/QA**.
7. **Completion**: Move tasks to **Done** after review.

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand the principles of working with Kanban boards and improved my skills in planning and managing tasks using Agile methodologies. Utilizing a Kanban board allows for effective organization of the workflow and transparency in task execution.
